## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```html

<p style="font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;text-align: center;font-weight: 700;">
    Improve your front-end skills by building projects
</p>

// Discovered font-weight.

```

```css
html, body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}  

// fixes the default white padding in some browsers. (in my case Brave)

height: 100vh; 

// vh value provides a way to make a blockline cover all of the page. (height in the case, vw fo width)

border-radius: 15px;

// Using border-radius to make the corners smoother.

```

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Crash Course 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YW65K6LcIA)
- [Flexbox Froggy Game](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - Both of these resources taught me everything I know about flexbox which helped me immensely build this qr code page.
